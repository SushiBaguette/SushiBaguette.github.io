        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This website is a collection of assorted ramblings that I decided to share, for some reason.</p>
        <p>The blog is <a href="blog/index.html">here</a>. I write about videogames, books, or anything else that goes through my mind.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to write <b>stories</b> so the blogging thing is mostly for practice.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your visit!</p>

        <p>Also note: this is an extremely lazy side-project, so I made the website myself. It's ugly as sin and extremely limited, but hopefully loads fast and works on mobile devices.</p>
