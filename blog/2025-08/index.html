        <h3>Internet of Mass</h3>
        <p>
            I miss no-bullshit informative websites that you didn't have to figure out to get what you clicked for. Websites which gave you what you wanted in the first screen: not a hook or a headline, a "call to action" or plain rage bait to make you scroll down. Plain information. Rough looking, maybe, but didn't waste time in meeting your expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wanted an album review? Boom, front and center, a small picture of the record if you were lucky and the promised block of text. Searched a recipe for grandma's scrumptious onion soup? You got table of ingredients and instructions. Granny's life story could wait. It wasn't not the most attractive, sure, but it got to the point and you could load it with internet speeds we'd consider human right violations nowadays.

            I know things didn't become like that for no reason, whether I like it or not. Hundreds of articles explain this better than I ever could; the number of devices to cater to exploded with smartphones, internet speeds got better which shifted priorities when designing a website, tooling for web development became so good it made optimization a kind of lost art, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe it all influenced my decision to try my hand at making a website, from scratch, stripping the unnecessary. And if on the way I make the mistakes that modern tools and frameworks solve: so be it. The best way to learn is to feel like a fool from times to time.

        <h3>Hello world!</h3>
        <p>
            Well, here is the first entry I guess. I feel like I have to explain why the site is so primitive, being a software developer by trade and all that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I considered using a dedicated blogging service or something like Wordpress. That would get me a fully-featured blog with all the bells and whistles, potentially better SEO down the line etc. Obviously, a ton better out-of-the-box than anything I could accomplish on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, I could make a static website all by myself, which is what I ended up doing. It only took me a couple of hours to set up and didn't cost a dime. The results are primitive looking but I am fine with that. Later this can look better but I need to brush up on my web development skills. I don't imagine the website will attract a ton of traffic but that's not what I am looking after yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main objective is to practice my writing skills, and having a sort of blog gives me a way to do that. At the moment, it's barely any better than keeping a physical diary but I am having fun, and I think that's what matters for now.
