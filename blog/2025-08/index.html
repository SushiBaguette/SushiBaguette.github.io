        <h3>Hello world!</h3>
        <p>
            Well, here is the first entry I guess. I feel like I have to explain why the site is so primitive, being a software developer by trade and all that.

            I considered using a dedicated blogging service or something like Wordpress. That would get me a fully-featured blog with all the bells and whistles, potentially better SOE down the line etc. Obviously, a ton better out-of-the-box than anything I could accomplish on my own.

            On the other hand, I could make a static website all by myself, which is what I ended up doing. It only took me a couple of hours to set up and didn't cost a dime. The results are primitive looking but I am fine with that. Later this can look better but I need to brush up on my web development skills. I don't imagine the website will attract a ton of traffic but that's not what I am looking after yet.

            My main objective is to practice my writing skills, and having a sort of blog gives me a way to do that. At the moment, it's barely any better than keeping a physical diary but I am having fun, and I think that's what matters for now.
